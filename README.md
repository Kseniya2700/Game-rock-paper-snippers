Report: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation

Overview

The provided JavaScript code implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a user competes against a computer. The game is designed with a clean UI interaction, score tracking, sound effects, and a replay functionality. The program determines a winner based on the classic rules of the game and announces the result.

Key Features

Game Mechanics:

The game is based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock).

The first to reach 3 wins is declared the overall winner.

User Interface:

Buttons allow the user to select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

The computer’s choice is randomly generated.

The score for both the user and computer is displayed in real-time.

Sound Effects:

Unique sound effects are played for a win, loss, or draw.

A click sound is played when the user interacts with buttons.

Dynamic Feedback:

Results of each round are displayed (win, loss, or draw).

Winning or losing choices are visually highlighted using CSS classes (winner, loser).

Replay Functionality:

The user can reset the game using a "Play Again" button.
